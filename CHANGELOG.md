## [Unreleased]

### Added — Phase 1 scaffold

- Initial repo skeleton with `bin/`, `scripts/`, `src/`, `templates/`, `examples/`.
- `bin/cwm-release` — wrapper around `scripts/release.sh`.
- `bin/cwm-bump` — wrapper around `scripts/bump.php`.
- `bin/cwm-package` — invokes `build.command` from project config.
- `bin/cwm-sync-configs` — wrapper around `scripts/sync-configs.php`.
- `bin/cwm-init` — scaffolding wrapper.
- `scripts/release.sh` — generic 8-step release pipeline (bump, build, push, GH release, changelog, ARS, versions.json, announcement).
- `scripts/bump.php` — multi-manifest version bumper driven by `cwm-build.config.json`.
- `scripts/sync-configs.php` — managed-block syncer (currently `.gitignore`).
- `scripts/ars-publish.php` — stub for ARS API upload (manual upload until Phase 1 completes).
- `templates/gitignore-managed.txt` — universal junk block synced into projects.
- `templates/cwm-build.config.json.tmpl` — per-project config skeleton.
- `examples/package/`, `examples/library/` — reference project configs.
- `.github/workflows/joomla-package-ci.yml` — reusable workflow for Joomla extension CI.
- `src/Config/ProjectConfig.php`, `src/Build/ManifestReader.php`, `src/Release/ArsPublisher.php` — PHP class skeletons for Phase 2+.

### Open before v1.0.0

- ARS API upload implementation in `src/Release/ArsPublisher.php` (currently a stub).
- `scripts/init.php` (the actual interactive scaffolder behind `bin/cwm-init`).
- `.editorconfig` and `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php` sync handlers in `sync-configs.php`.
- Templates: `.editorconfig`, `.php-cs-fixer.base.php`, `phpunit.xml.tmpl`.
- Reusable `joomla-library-ci.yml` workflow.
- Wire CWMScriptureLinks as the first consumer to validate the design end-to-end.
